# CraigslistScraper
Basic Scraper for Craigslist w/ GUI

## Overview
This Python script is designed to provide users email notifications when new items go up on Craigslist in their area. Running the script prompts a GUI to open up where the user enters a refresh time, a Craigslist "for sale" URL, and the email to send the notifications to.

** Note: The user will have to add their own email and app password in line 34 of the code. (https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en)
